Hi! It's your first guide in **GoBarber**.
This app was developed  in Rocketseat BootCamp.


With this project I've practiced:

 2. Docker
 3. ORM (Sequelize)
 4. MVC
 5. JWT auth
 6. Image uploads ( Multer )
 7. Validations ( YUP )
 8. Middlewares
 9. MongoDB + Mongoose ( Notifications )
 10. Postgres
 11. Redis
 12. E-mail ( Nodemailer + MailTrap)
 13. Sentry ( App monitoring, "Exceptions" )
 14. Express ( Node Framework )
 15. And more


...

## How to
You will need `yarn`  installed on your machine.

Run the following commands inside the project folder:
